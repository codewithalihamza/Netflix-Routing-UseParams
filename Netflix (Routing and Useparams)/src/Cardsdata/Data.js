As he grows into a man, he undergoes a journey of self-identity, using the guidance of his ancestor (Beyoncé), childhood love and his own subconscious to reclaim his throne. The prince's journey acts as an allegory for the African diaspora's journey of discovering, reclaiming and celebrating their culture and heritage, which is echoed by the inclusion of spoken-word poetry that focuses on the question of black identity.",
